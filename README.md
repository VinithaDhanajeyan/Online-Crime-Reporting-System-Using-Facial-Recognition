# Online Crime Reporting System using Face Recognition

## 👩‍💻 Project by:
**VINITHA D**  
**Roll No:** 212222230175  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **Online Crime Reporting System** that incorporates **Face Recognition** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The system is designed to assist both the public and law enforcement by allowing users to file complaints online and enabling police to manage and track criminal data effectively.

---

## 🔍 Abstract

The Crime Reporting System is a comprehensive case management platform for police departments. It allows users to:
- Submit complaints online
- Track complaint status
- Use face recognition to match criminals with a pre-registered database

The core of the system relies on CNN models for accurate face recognition (achieving 99% accuracy) and ensures secure storage of user credentials with hashed encryption.

## 📚 Literature Survey

The system builds upon prior works involving:
- Face recognition for crime detection
- Online crime complaint portals
- Crime rate notification systems
- 3D shape reconstruction for suspect identification

## ❌ Existing System Drawbacks

- Inconsistent recognition under varying lighting or facial angles
- High computational cost
- Limited scalability due to memory and processing constraints

---

## ✅ Proposed System Features

- Integration of algorithms for historical data and face image recognition
- Secure, intuitive, and accessible web interface
- Enhanced transparency and trust in law enforcement processes
- Streamlit-based interface for real-time recognition using key frames

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask/Streamlit
- **Machine Learning:** CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB (depending on deployment)
- **Security:** Encrypted passwords using hashing algorithms
